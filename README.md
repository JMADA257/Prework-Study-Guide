# Prework-Study-Guide
A study guide for Programming bootcamp.
# <Jordan's Prework Study Guide!>

## Description

Welcome to my study guide! My motivation to create this was to give myself something to look at and take notes down while im going through the programming bootcamp. This helps me solve things like remember basic commands in the command line, also basic knowledge about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Ive learned alot already doing the prework but know theres much more to come but now I am able to atleast build this website!


## Installation

Downloading the proper tools was the only installations I required.

## Usage

This will help me take notes, go back and study. Also i can open the console on the website and have the website tell me what to study!
